# CZ4010-Cryptography-Project

This is a project conducted by Ong Yi Shen and Davin Ryo Tanada 
as the CZ4010 second semester project. This project involves demonstrations
of multiple potential attacks against the RSA cryptosystem.

The project will demonstrate the following attacks:
- Small encryption exponent
- Small decryption exponent
- Common Modulus
- Blinding signature
